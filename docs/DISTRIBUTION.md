# Openhook distribution tracker

Last checked: 2026-10-14 (Europe/Berlin). Submission does not mean curator acceptance or new users.

## Published installation

The [agent skill](../skills/openhook/README.md) is public on main through
[PR #10](https://github.com/openhook-dev/openhook-inbox/pull/10).

```sh
npx skills add openhook-dev/openhook-inbox --skill openhook
```

Verified public discovery with `npx skills add openhook-dev/openhook-inbox --list`.
The project passed 97 Python tests and the generated-docs check. Both CI runs
passed before merge. The hosted first-callback example successfully sent and read
a matching payload, then cleaned up its disposable inbox again on 2026-10-14.

## Official MCP Registry

Published version `0.1.0` of `io.github.openhook-dev/openhook-inbox` and verified
its [public registry record](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0.1/servers?search=io.github.openhook-dev/openhook-inbox)
is `active` and latest. It points to `https://openhook.dev/mcp`, this repository,
and the Openhook website. Publication completed in
[workflow run 38479763582](https://github.com/openhook-dev/openhook-inbox/actions/runs/38479763582)

or evidence of customer adoption. See [releasing](releasing.md) for updates.

## Existing third-party discovery

The [M8ven Trust Index listing](https://m8ven.ai/mcp/openhook-dev/openhook-inbox)
was verified publicly on 2026-10-13. M8ven found the repository through GitHub
search; this was not a submission from this campaign. The listing remains
unclaimed and live monitoring is not connected.

It displays 74/100 (grade C) for commit `f6ac7c7`, scanned on 2026-10-11.
M8ven reports no concerning findings and says new projects are capped at C
until they earn adoption. This is their static assessment of an older commit,
not a current-release security guarantee or evidence of independent users.

No new human maintainer feedback was present on the three earlier review-ready
collection PRs at the latest 2026-10-14 check. The Agent Skill Exchange PR also
had no feedback at submission. Check existing receipts and PRs before following up.

## Deferred destinations

- block/agent-skills is archived as checked on 2026-10-14; no submission.
- JackyST0/awesome-agent-skills requires 64 GitHub stars by default; defer until
  eligibility is established rather than requesting an exception for promotion.
- [Launch MCP](https://launchmcp.co/submit): duplicate check found no listing or
  pending submission. Free submission is prepared but was blocked by automatic
  approval review because it requires sending the support email to a new third
  party. Await specific approval; no submission occurred.
- [Skills Directory](https://www.skillsdirectory.com/): submission redirects to
  sign-in/account creation. No account or listing was created.
- [PulseMCP](https://www.pulsemcp.com/): homepage explicitly says new server
  submissions and listing changes are paused. Revisit when submissions reopen.
- [VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills):
  requires established community usage. Revisit when independent usage can be
  demonstrated; do not represent internal testing as adoption.
- [punkpeye/awesome-remote-mcp-servers](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-remote-mcp-servers):
  requires a Glama connector listing and resolving badge. Revisit after validation.
- appcypher/awesome-mcp-servers is archived; no submission.
- wong2/awesome-mcp-servers directs submissions to mcpservers.org and does not
  accept listing PRs. The website submission above follows that route.

## Submission conventions

Read each destination's current contribution rules and search for existing
entries and PRs before submitting. Use factual descriptions, disclose maintainer
affiliation, and keep one relevant project per contribution. No paid placement
or fabricated usage claims. Track approvals separately from submissions.

Canonical source: https://github.com/openhook-dev/openhook-inbox

Hosted MCP endpoint: https://openhook.dev/mcp

Suggested description: Open-source webhook inbox with an MCP interface for AI
agents to capture callbacks, inspect payloads, and forward events to local handlers.

For acquisition measurement, compare referral traffic in Umami with new account
and product-usage evidence. Page views, internal QA, and anonymous test inboxes
are not proof of independent users or paid customers.

## Articles and social posts

The [posting plan](gtm/posting-plan.md) includes one complete callback tutorial,
short X and LinkedIn drafts, two follow-on article experiments, and current
platform rules. No article or social post has been published to an external
account. The tutorial's callback example passed again on 2026-10-14. HN requires
human-written posts; DEV's published AI-content policy restricts business promotion.
The selected publishing account is still pending.
